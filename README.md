# SPOJ_POTHOLE
C++ solution to the Sphere Online Judge Problem "Potholers", a Max-Flow type problem.
Code written by Madi Binyon for Whitworth University's CS-473, Fall 2020.

What is it:  This code is my C++ solution to a problem that utilizes the Max-Flow algorithm in order to be solved.  The concept is that miners can only enter a cave through different introdctory routes and must do the same whiile exiting, but can traveerse the same paths once inside the cave.  The code should be able to discover how many splunkers can traverse a certain cave at one time.

Why did I post it: I wanted to showcase my code/commenting style in a lannguage I am comfortable with.  I have been coding in C++ for 4 years now, and I felt this problem was a good way to show how I go about writing code from scratch and explaing my logic through comments.
